General comments:
Compiling this code out-of-the-box will give you a screen test application that will run through a few colors and patterns allowing you to ensure that the hardware is working before exploring the installation of drivers. This package also provides a simple "api" to push images to the screen, this can be useful for creating applications that directly use the screen instead of the standard console for display and input.
